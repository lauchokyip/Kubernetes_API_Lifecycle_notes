# Kubernetes Notes 
* Kubernetes as an orchestrator. **Orchestrator is just an fancy work for a system that takes care of deploying and managing applications** 
* Similar to OS which creates an abstraction between CPU, memory, storage and networking, Kubernetes creates an abstraction between cloud and center resources. 
* Simple steps to run applications on Kubernetes cluster </br>
  1) Write application as small independent microservices
  2) Package them in a container
  3) Wrap each container in a Pod
  4) Deploy Pods to the cluster via controllers such as **Deployments, DaemonSets, StatefulSets and Cronjobs**
* ***Deployments*** offer scalability and rolling updates, ***DaemonSets*** run one instance of a service on every nod ein the cluster, ***StatefulSets*** are for 
stateful applicatoin components, ***CronJobs*** are for short-lived tasks that need t orun at set times
*
